1. What we know about objects
Objects are: A mechanism to encapsulate data(state) and methods
  Information that can be acted upon
  Modeled after cells
    - self contained - but able to work together through communication



  Factory mechanism with objects
  Scope our methods - hard to do with hashes
  Scope our data

Classes are BOTH the factory and blueprints for the object

  - objects are models for what the code is supposed to do
  - objects are abstractions of data
  - objects - blueprints - telling you what to do or how to do it
      - simplfying the code
    - hashes - remember where everything is, trying to memorize a map
    - use them through dot notation and with arguments we want to pass

2. Why do we even need objects?
   - condensing 
   - without them, code woudln't know what to do
3. Object mechanics
  I. Object instances
    - object life cycle
    - instance methods
    - instance variables
    - scope
  II. Class methods and class variables
    - 
  III. Self referencing with objects
